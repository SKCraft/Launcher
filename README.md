------------

This project provides an open-source Minecraft launcher platform for downloading,
installing, and updating modpacks.

Introduction
------------

This launcher is maintained by sk89q, who writes WorldEdit, WorldGuard, and so on. It has
been primarily developed for his server, but you can use it for your own modpack or
server.

* One of Minecraft's oldest launchers -- since Minecraft Alpha
* Requires almost no configuration files to make a modpack
* Add a new mod by dropping in the .jar (and its configuration)
* Remove a mod by deleting its .jar (and configuration).
* Builds **server** modpacks with no extra configuration
* Advanced download system: incremental, file removal detection, optional feature/mod selection, etc.
* Very easy for users to use and install modpacks
* Pretty well-documented with easy-to-understand, well-organized code*
* Open source!

*Except for the Launcher frame class. That one is pretty bad.

### Previous Versions

This repository only contains code for the launcher versions 4.x and newer.

Documentation
-------------

First off, be aware that the launcher in this directory has been branded for sk89q's
server, so you will have to replace that with your own. There's only a few places that
you need to do that, and it's all documented on our documentation page.

**You can fork the project on GitHub** and make modifications.

* [Documentation](http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/Launcher)

Note that documentation may be lacking in some places. If you run into problems,
**do not hesitate to ask**.

If you want to contact me about some sort of partnership, want to make the launcher
the official launcher for something, please email me (see
[my website](http://www.sk89q.com/contact/)). While you do not have to do this, we
can make future decisions with awareness of what the needs of other users may be.

Compiling
---------

The launcher can be compiled using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

    mvn clean package

If you wish to import the project into an IDE, you must add support for
Project Lombok.
