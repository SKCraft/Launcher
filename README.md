SKCraft Launcher
================

SKCraft Launcher provides a platform for creating, testing, and distributing modpacks for groups of all sizes. It 100% open source and works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux/BSD.

With this platform, you have **full control** of the modpacks that you choose to release.

### Many Features, Few Requirements

The only requirement is **have a website to host files**.

* zero times where you ever have to edit XML or JSON files
* multiple modpack support
* deduplication of files (only upload a mod once for all modpacks)
* delta downloads when updating (only download changed files)
* download resume
* no need to host old versions; users can always update
* no PHP or server setup necessary
* compatible with all standard website hosting and CDNs
* optional mods/files
* support for default configuration files
* modpack-specific Java flags
* support for LiteLoader, Forge, and JAR mods
* support for resource packs
* support for all and any files
* "hidden" modpacks that require a special access key **

** requires PHP support on your website

### Making Modpacks

Making modpacks is extremely easy: you can use our creator tools with 1-click modpack testing:

You *don't* have to click a bunch of buttons or edit several cryptic config files to add a mod. All you need to do is create a folder that resembles the Minecraft data folder:

* src/**config**/
* src/**mods**/
* src/**resourcepacks**/
* loaders/

There's support for Minecraft Forge and LiteLoader too — just put their installer .jars into the loaders folder.

Now let's see how easy it is to create an "optional feature" that can turn off not only mods, but configuration files too:

### Great Client

The launcher has a beautiful dark UI that's elegant and easy to use (although a native UI is also available). Display your own webpages so users always know what's up when they start the game.

When it comes to launching your modpacks, users can start, abort, and resume updates at any time. Files are downloaded in parallel, and the launcher knows how to handle the removal of files from the modpack.

Users can select those optional features that you have added:

The launcher can **even update itself**.

...and you can use it in portable mode too.

### More Features

All of the modpack tools can be used to create a server modpack alongside the client modpack!

You can optionally use **command line tools** only, without the GUI entirely. Combine the launcher with Git and Jenkins (or whatever you prefer) to automatically build modpack releases when you push a new version.

### History

The launcher has been in development since the early days of Minecraft Alpha. It has powered and always has powered sk89q's own server, SKCraft.

[The older 3.x version was can be found elsewhere](https://github.com/sk89q/SKMCLauncher).
